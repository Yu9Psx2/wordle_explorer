# wordle_explorer
an exploration of wordle

There are several things that I want to try with respect to wordle:

1. Find out which words make the best first guess (Completed May 7 in wordle.ipynb)
2. Code the logic of the game so that I can play it in the terminal (Completed May 14 in wordle_script.py - need to isolate this code from the other steps)
3. Setup a script to play the game algorithmically (In process in wordle_script.py, I need to find a way to redo step 2 so that playing the game in the terminal is an import) Completed May 22
3b. I need to:
    - Find a larger dictionary of 5 letter words
    - Add in an option for user-input or to play the game automatically using the automatic best choice
    - Find a way to run the game automatically and record the results
4. Play the game using machine learning (Not sure if this is too much of a stretch goal)
